## What is Project Lumière?
It is where a random bloke on the internet do free labour as an amature data scientist in the hope that some other random bloke over the other side of the internet will eventually find something useful to them. I'll be doing data analysis off of publicly availble datasets, making data visualization dashboards, creating templates for said analysis and/or dashboards, and also any side projects that are a) related to data science and b) I belief people could find it useful if I open source it.

## How to support Project Lumière?
As of right now and into the forseeable future, Project Lumière **will not** be accepting any form of material donation. If you want to support Project Lumière, you could either contribute to the codebase or let me know that what I do here is not complete garbage.

## Why is it called Project Lumière?
### Simple answer: 
named after some cute anime girl vtuber

### Lengthier answer: 
I belief in open sourcing stuff. I belief science and art should be free of social-political barrier. I ain't no artist but maybe maybe maybe I can get something out to the world, similar to shining light into places where it would be dark otherwise. 

## Disclaimer
I am not a professional data scientist. Use Project Lumière at your own risk.
